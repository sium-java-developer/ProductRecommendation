Product Recommendation System Project Description

Overview

This project implements a robust product recommendation system designed to provide personalized recommendations to users based on their preferences and behavior. Leveraging advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques, the system effectively analyzes user data to suggest relevant products.

Key Features

    Collaborative Filtering: Utilizes user-based and item-based collaborative filtering to recommend products similar to those preferred by like-minded users.
    Content-Based Filtering: Recommends products based on their content similarity to previously rated or purchased items.
    Hybrid Approach: Combines collaborative and content-based filtering for a more comprehensive and accurate recommendation system.
    Real-time Recommendations: Provides recommendations in real-time as users interact with the platform.
    User Preference Learning: Continuously learns user preferences to improve recommendation accuracy over time.
    Scalability: Designed to handle large datasets and scale efficiently as the user base grows.

Technologies Used

    Spring Boot: A popular Java-based framework for building microservices and web applications.
    Spring Data JPA: Simplifies data access and persistence with JPA.
    Thymeleaf: A Java-based templating engine for creating dynamic HTML views.
    Bootstrap: A popular CSS framework for responsive web design.
    Docker: Containerization technology for packaging and deploying the application.
    H2 Database: An in-memory database for development and testing.
    Apache Mahout: Apache Mahout(TM) is a distributed linear algebra framework and mathematically expressive Scala DSL designed to let mathematicians, statisticians, and data scientists quickly implement their own algorithms.

Project Structure

The project follows a well-structured architecture with clear separation of concerns. It includes the following components:

    Model: Contains entities representing products, users, and ratings.
    Repository: Defines data access methods using Spring Data JPA.
    Service: Provides business logic for interacting with data and performing recommendation calculations.
    Controller: Handles HTTP requests and responses.
    Templates: Contains HTML templates for the user interface.
    Dockerfile: Defines the Docker image configuration for deployment.

This product recommendation system offers a valuable solution for businesses looking to enhance customer engagement and drive sales through personalized product suggestions.
